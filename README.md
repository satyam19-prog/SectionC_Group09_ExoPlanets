## Project

Overview

The ExoPlanets Project is a collaborative academic data analytics project focused on analyzing and visualizing exoplanet discovery data to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and detection biases in modern astronomy. Developed by Group 09 (Section C) with six team members, the project follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow—from raw data ingestion to insight-driven dashboards and reporting.

Project Objectives

Analyze exoplanet discovery trends across time, distance, and detection methods
Identify observational biases introduced by different discovery techniques
Compare planetary characteristics such as mass, radius, orbital period, and host star properties
Transform raw scientific data into clear, decision-oriented insights

Key Features

Raw & Cleaned Datasets
Original exoplanet data preserved for auditability
Cleaned and standardized datasets for analysis readiness
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Missing value handling
Data type corrections
Logical binning of continuous variables (mass, period, distance, star properties)
Fully documented cleaning steps
Analytical Processing
Pivot tables for trend analysis and comparative studies
KPI calculations (counts, averages, percentages, year-over-year growth)
Bias-focused analysis across discovery methods and distance ranges
Visualization & Dashboards
Interactive dashboards built from pivot-based analysis
Charts highlighting dominance, composition, and distribution patterns
Clear separation between analysis and storytelling layers
Documentation & Presentation
Structured reports explaining methodology, insights, and conclusions
Presentation materials summarizing key findings for evaluation and review
Collaborative Development
Multi-member contribution tracked via GitHub commits
Organized repository structure for clarity and reproducibility
