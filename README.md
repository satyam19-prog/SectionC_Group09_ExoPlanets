## 🧠 Project Overview

The discovery of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) has accelerated due to advances in detection technologies. However, historical exoplanet datasets are strongly influenced by **observational bias, detection feasibility, and technological limitations**.

This project analyzes historical exoplanet data to:
- Evaluate discovery efficiency across methods
- Understand technology-driven discovery trends
- Identify bias in detected planet populations
- Support data-driven decision-making for future space missions

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Notes

The raw dataset contained:
- Scientific uncertainty values (±, ranges, citations)
- Mixed numeric and text formats
- Inconsistent categorical naming
- High missing-value density

### Cleaning Actions
- Extracted best-estimate numeric values
- Removed uncertainty ranges and symbols
- Standardized measurement units
- Created analytical categories
- Ensured planet-level uniqueness

All cleaning steps were documented in `Cleaning_Log.md`.

## 📊 Key Insights & Statistics

- **Transit method** accounts for the majority of exoplanet discoveries
- Discovery volume increased sharply after **2005**, driven by technology
- **Large and close-in planets** are over-represented
- Imaging methods detect **fewer but massive and distant planets**
- Detection diversity decreases significantly with distance

## 📈 Dashboard Summary

The dashboard provides:

### Executive View
- Total exoplanets discovered
- Average distance from Earth
- Average host star temperature

### Operational View
- Discovery method dominance
- Bias across mass, distance, and orbital period
- Year-wise discovery trends
- Interactive filters for drill-down analysis

## 🧭 Recommendations

- Prioritize scalable transit survey missions
- Use radial velocity for confirmation
- Reserve imaging for distant massive planets
- Invest in high-sensitivity instruments
- Adopt hybrid detection strategies

---

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Scope

### Limitations
- Observational and technological bias
- Incomplete physical parameters
- Limited post-2009 data

### Future Scope
- Integration of Kepler, TESS, JWST datasets
- Bias-correction modeling
- Advanced habitability analysis
- Real-time dashboard updates

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Google Sheets (Cleaning, Pivots, Dashboard)
- Spreadsheet Functions & Pivot Tables
- Looker Studio (optional)
- Markdown & PDF
- PowerPoint

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates that exoplanet discovery patterns are shaped more by **technology and feasibility** than by true planetary abundance. By acknowledging bias and constraints, the analysis provides realistic and decision-oriented insights for future space exploration strategies.
